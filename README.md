1.1 Purpose 
<Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document, including the 
revision or release number. Describe the scope of the product that is covered by this SRS, 
particularly if this SRS describes only part of the system or a single subsystem.>

1.4 Product Scope
<Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, including relevant 
benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to corporate goals or business strategies. If a 
separate vision and scope document is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents 
here.>

3.1 User Interfaces
<Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users. 
This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards or product family style guides that are 
to be followed, screen layout constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will 
appear on every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on. Define 
the software components for which a user interface is needed. Details of the user interface design 
should be documented in a separate user interface specification.>
  
 3.3 Software Interfaces
<Describe the connections between this product and other specific software components (name 
and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, libraries, and integrated commercial 
components. Identify the data items or messages coming into the system and going out and 
describe the purpose of each. Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. 
Refer to documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols. Identify 
data that will be shared across software components. If the data sharing mechanism must be 
implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a global data area in a multitasking operating 
system), specify this as an implementation constraint.>
